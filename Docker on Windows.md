### Docker images
A Docker image is a complete application package. It contains one application and all of its
dependencies, the language runtime, the application host, and the underlying operating
system

### Docker containers
A container is an instance of an application created from an image. The image contains the whole application stack, and it also specifies the process to start the application, so Docker knows what to do when you run a container.
