Essential Docker for .Net Developer

### Command

##

The Docker image used to deploy ASP.NET Core applications does not contain the .NET Core compiler,
which means you must use the dotnet publish command to create a directory that contains the compiled
code and all of the support files required to run the application

```
dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1 --configuration Release --output dist
```

##

This command publishes the application into a folder called dist, which can be incorporated in the
image using the COPY command in a Docker file. The Docker file is processed to create the image using the
docker build command.

```
docker build . -t apress/exampleapp -f Dockerfile
```

The first argument is a period, indicating the current working directory, which sets the context directory
on which the commands in the Docker file are performed. The -t argument specifies the name of the image,
and the -f argument specifies the Docker file

##

Containers are created using the docker create command, like this:

```
docker create -p 3000:80 --name exampleApp3000 apress/exampleapp
```

Once a container has been created, it can be started using the docker start command.

```
docker start exampleApp3000
```

You can create and start a container in a single step using the docker run command.

```
docker run -p 3000:80 --name exampleApp4000 apress/exampleapp
```

## Docker Volumes Quick Reference

Volumes allow data files to be stored outside of a container, which means they are not deleted when the
container is deleted or updated.
Volumes are defined using the VOLUME command in Docker files, like this:

```
VOLUME /var/lib/mysql
```

This tells Docker that the files in the /var/lib/mysql folder should be stored in a volume. This is useful
only when a named volume is created and applied when configuring the container. Volumes are created
using the docker volume create command, like this:
docker volume create --name productdata
The --name argument is used to specify a name for the volume, which is then used with the -v argument
to the docker create or docker run command like this:

```
docker run --name mysql -v productdata:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecret -e
bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:8.0.0
```

This command tells Docker that the productdata volume will be used to provide
the contents of the /var/lib/mysql directory in the containerâ€™s file system. Removing the container wonâ€™t
remove the volume, which means that any files that are created in the /var/lib/mysql directory wonâ€™t be
deleted, allowing the result of user actions to be stored persistently.

## Essential Commands for Working with Volumes

| Command              | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

| docker volume ls     | This command lists the volumes that have been created. The -q argument returns a list of unique IDs, which can be used to delete multiple volumes using the docker volume rm command. |
| docker volume rm     | This command removes one or more volumes.                                                                                                                                             |

## 
Software-defined networks are used to connect containers together, using networks that are created and managed using Docker

Software-defined networks are created using the docker network create command, like this:
```
docker network create backend
```

This command creates a software-defined network called backend. Containers can be connected to the
network using the --network argument to the docker create or docker start command, like this:
```
docker run -d --name mysql -v productdata:/var/lib/mysql --network=backend -e
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecret -e bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:8.0.0
```

Containers can also be connected to software-defined networks using the docker network connect
command, like this:
```
docker network connect frontend productapp1
```
This command connects the container called productapp1 to the software-defined network called
frontend.

| build       | This keyword is used to denote the section that specifies how the image for a container will be created.                                                                                                                        |
| context     | This keyword specifies the context directory that will be used when building the image for a container.                                                                                                                         |
| dockerfile  | This keyword specifies the Docker file that will be used when building the image for a container.                                                                                                                               |

| depends_on  | This keyword is used to specify dependencies between services. Docker doesnâ€™t have insight into when applications in containers are ready, so additional steps must be taken to control the startup sequence of an application |

## 
Docker files are processed using the docker-compose build command like this:
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

The containers, networks, and volumes in a compose file are created and starting using the
docker-compose up command.
```
docker-compose up
```

## Essential Commands for Docker Compose
| Command              | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| docker-compose build | This command processes the contents of the compose file and creates the images required for the services it contains.                                                  |
| docker-compose up    | This command creates the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the compose file and starts the containers.                                                      |
| docker-compose stop  | This command stops the containers created from the services in the compose file. The containers, networks, and volumes are left in place so they can be started again. |
| docker-compose down  | This command stops the containers created from the services in the compose file and removes them, along with the networks and volumes.                                 |
| docker-compose scale | This command changes the number of containers that are running for a service.                                                                                          |
| docker-compose ps    | This command lists the containers that have been created for the services defined in the compose file.                                                                 |
