Essential Docker for .Net Developer

### Command

##

The Docker image used to deploy ASP.NET Core applications does not contain the .NET Core compiler,
which means you must use the dotnet publish command to create a directory that contains the compiled
code and all of the support files required to run the application

```
dotnet publish --framework netcoreapp1.1 --configuration Release --output dist
```

##

This command publishes the application into a folder called dist, which can be incorporated in the
image using the COPY command in a Docker file. The Docker file is processed to create the image using the
docker build command.

```
docker build . -t apress/exampleapp -f Dockerfile
```

The first argument is a period, indicating the current working directory, which sets the context directory
on which the commands in the Docker file are performed. The -t argument specifies the name of the image,
and the -f argument specifies the Docker file

##

Containers are created using the docker create command, like this:

```
docker create -p 3000:80 --name exampleApp3000 apress/exampleapp
```

Once a container has been created, it can be started using the docker start command.

```
docker start exampleApp3000
```

You can create and start a container in a single step using the docker run command.

```
docker run -p 3000:80 --name exampleApp4000 apress/exampleapp
```

## Docker Volumes Quick Reference

Volumes allow data files to be stored outside of a container, which means they are not deleted when the
container is deleted or updated.
Volumes are defined using the VOLUME command in Docker files, like this:

```
VOLUME /var/lib/mysql
```

This tells Docker that the files in the /var/lib/mysql folder should be stored in a volume. This is useful
only when a named volume is created and applied when configuring the container. Volumes are created
using the docker volume create command, like this:
docker volume create --name productdata
The --name argument is used to specify a name for the volume, which is then used with the -v argument
to the docker create or docker run command like this:

```
docker run --name mysql -v productdata:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecret -e
bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:8.0.0
```

This command tells Docker that the productdata volume will be used to provide
the contents of the /var/lib/mysql directory in the containerâ€™s file system. Removing the container wonâ€™t
remove the volume, which means that any files that are created in the /var/lib/mysql directory wonâ€™t be
deleted, allowing the result of user actions to be stored persistently.

## Essential Commands for Working with Volumes

| Command              | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |

| docker volume ls     | This command lists the volumes that have been created. The -q argument returns a list of unique IDs, which can be used to delete multiple volumes using the docker volume rm command. |
| docker volume rm     | This command removes one or more volumes.                                                                                                                                             |

##

Software-defined networks are used to connect containers together, using networks that are created and managed using Docker

Software-defined networks are created using the docker network create command, like this:

```
docker network create backend
```

This command creates a software-defined network called backend. Containers can be connected to the
network using the --network argument to the docker create or docker start command, like this:

```
docker run -d --name mysql -v productdata:/var/lib/mysql --network=backend -e
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecret -e bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:8.0.0
```

Containers can also be connected to software-defined networks using the docker network connect
command, like this:

```
docker network connect frontend productapp1
```

This command connects the container called productapp1 to the software-defined network called
frontend.

##

Docker files are processed using the docker-compose build command like this:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml build
```

The containers, networks, and volumes in a compose file are created and starting using the
docker-compose up command.

```
docker-compose up
```

## Essential Commands for Docker Compose

| Command              | Description                                                                                                                                                            |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| docker-compose build | This command processes the contents of the compose file and creates the images required for the services it contains.                                                  |
| docker-compose up    | This command creates the containers, networks, and volumes defined in the compose file and starts the containers.                                                      |
| docker-compose stop  | This command stops the containers created from the services in the compose file. The containers, networks, and volumes are left in place so they can be started again. |

| docker-compose scale | This command changes the number of containers that are running for a service.                                                                                          |
| docker-compose ps    | This command lists the containers that have been created for the services defined in the compose file.                                                                 |

## Docker Swarm Quick Reference

A Docker swarm is a cluster of servers that run containers. There are worker nodes that run the containers
and manager nodes that determine which containers run on individual nodes and ensure that the right
number of containers are running for each service. Swarms automatically try to recover when containers or
nodes fail.

A swarm is created by running the following command on a manager node:

```
docker swarm init
```

## Essential Commands for Docker Swarms

| Command               | Description                                                                            |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| docker swarm init     | This command runs on manager nodes to create a swarm.                                  |
| docker swarm join     | This command runs on worker nodes to join a swarm.                                     |
| docker node ls        | This command displays a list of the nodes in the swarm.                                |
| docker node update    | This command changes the configuration of a node in the swarm.                         |
| docker service create | This command manually starts a new service on the swarm.                               |

## The path from image to container to service

<img src="img/The path from image to container to service.png">

### Creating a Custom Image

```
docker build . -t apress/exampleapp -f Dockerfile
```

The docker build command creates a new image. The period that follows the build keyword provides
the context, which is the location that is used for commands such as COPY in the Docker file. The -t argument
tags the new image as apress/exampleapp, and the -f argument specifies the Docker file that contains
the instructions for creating the image. (The convention for naming images is to use your name or your
organizationâ€™s name, followed by the application name.)

### Creating Containers

```
docker create -p 3000:80 --name exampleApp3000 apress/exampleapp
```

- The docker create command is used to create a new image.
- The -p argument to the docker create command tells Docker how to map port 80 inside the container
  to the host operating system
- The --name argument assigns a name to the container, which makes it easier to work with once it
  has been created. The name in this case is exampleApp3000, indicating that this container will respond to
  requests sent to port 3000 in the host operating system.
- The final argument tells Docker which image to use as the template for the new container. This
  command specifies the apress/exampleapp image

### Starting Containers

```
docker start exampleApp3000
```

### Starting All Containers

```
docker start $(docker ps -aq)
```

The command combines docker start with the output of the docker ps command. The -a argument
includes containers that are not running, and the -q argument returns just the container IDs.

### Stopping Containers

Containers are stopped using the docker stop command, which can stop one or more containers by name
or by ID.

```
docker stop exampleApp3000
```

### Stopping All Containers

```
docker stop $(docker ps -q)
```

### Getting Container Output

```
docker logs exampleApp3000
```

### Following a Containerâ€™s Logs

```
docker start exampleApp3000
docker logs -f exampleApp3000
```

### Creating and Starting Containers with a Single Command

The docker run command is used to create a container from an image and start it in a single step,
combining the effects of the docker create and docker start commands

```
docker run -p 5000:80 --name exampleApp5000 apress/exampleapp
```

### REMOVING CONTAINERS AUTOMATICALLY

The docker run command can be used with the --rm argument, which tells Docker to remove the
container when it stops. Run this command to create a container that maps port 6500 in the host
container to port 80 in the new container

```
docker run -p 6500:80 --rm --name exampleApp6500 apress/exampleapp
```

#### Creating and Starting a MySQL Container

```
docker run -d --name mysql -v productdata:/var/lib/mysql -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysecret -e bind-address=0.0.0.0 mysql:8.0.0
```

| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| -d                             | This argument tells Docker to run the container in the background without attaching to it to display the output.                                                                         |
| --name                         | This argument is used to assign the name mysql to the container, which makes it easier to refer to in other Docker commands.                                                             |
| -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD         | This argument sets an environment variable. In this case, the MySQL container uses the MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD environment variable to set the password required to connect to the database. |
| -e bind-address                | This argument sets an environment variable. This environment variable ensures that MySQL accepts requests on all network interfaces.                                                     |
| -v productdata:/var/ lib/mysql | This argument tells Docker to use a volume called productdata to provide the contents of the containerâ€™s /var/lib/mysql directory                                                        |

##### Examining the Docker Virtual Network

```
docker network inspect bridge
```

#### Software-Defined Networks SDN

The virtual network that allowed the containers to communicate in the previous section is an example of a
software-defined network (SDN).

#### Creating Custom Networks

Custom software-defined networks are created using the docker network create command, followed by
the name for the new network

```
docker network create frontend
```
